# JoinMastodon.org Prototype

This is a UX prototype for an informational page for the Mastodon project. That means it's mostly hardcoded, just to give an idea of look and feel and interactions. Everything is hardcoded, this doesn't call out or link out to anywhere.

## Taking a look

1. Clone it
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`
4. Wait for a browser to open with the site (It might take a couple minutes, create-react-app is clever but not quick)
